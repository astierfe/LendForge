feat(frontend): Complete Phase 3 - Dashboard components with user position tracking

## Summary
Implemented all 4 dashboard cards to display user collateral, borrowing position,
health factor gauge, and quick action buttons. Fixed critical bug in max borrowable
calculation and added responsive 2-column grid layout.

## Components Added
- **UserPositionCard**: Displays total borrowed, available to borrow, and LTV usage
  - Shows ETH borrowed with USD conversion
  - Calculates available borrowing capacity
  - Warns when LTV usage >= 80%
  - Links to borrow/repay pages

- **HealthFactorDisplay**: Visual gauge component for account health
  - Semi-circular gauge with color-coded risk levels
  - Needle indicator pointing to current HF value
  - Threshold markers at 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0
  - Contextual risk explanations (Safe/Warning/Danger/Liquidation)
  - Empty state for users without active borrows

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed `calculateMaxBorrowable()` in useHealthFactor.ts:
  - Now returns max borrowable amount (not available amount)
  - Implements proper weighted LTV calculation based on collateral USD values
  - Correctly calculates borrowing capacity for multi-asset collateral

## Layout Improvements
- Dashboard now uses responsive 2-column grid (lg:grid-cols-2)
- Mobile: 1 card per row (stacked vertically)
- Desktop: 2 cards per row
- Maintains proper spacing and visual hierarchy

## Test Pages
- `/test-user-position-card` - Test borrowing position display
- `/test-health-factor` - Test health factor gauge and risk levels

## Files Changed
- frontend/components/dashboard/UserPositionCard.tsx (new)
- frontend/components/dashboard/HealthFactorDisplay.tsx (new)
- frontend/hooks/useHealthFactor.ts (bug fix)
- frontend/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/page.tsx (layout update)
- frontend/app/(authenticated)/test-user-position-card/page.tsx (new)
- frontend/app/(authenticated)/test-health-factor/page.tsx (new)

## Technical Details
- Uses useUserPosition and useHealthFactor hooks for data
- Implements proper weighted LTV calculation for multi-collateral
- ETH price hardcoded at $2,500 (to be replaced with oracle integration)
- SVG-based gauge with responsive viewBox
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design

## Breaking Changes
None

## Migration Required
None

Closes Phase 3 of frontend development roadmap.
